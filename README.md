# Introduction

This configuration flake presently represents an initial exercise into managing
our system and user configurations via nix flakes and home-manager. Moreover we
hope it serves as a motivation to investigate NixOS more generally. For this
reason we purposefully avoid some of the more structured and layered frameworks
and their utility libraries mentioned in the [References](#References) below,
but try to take some structural cues.

We maintain another repo of user configurations.

# Structure

1. Platform specific configurations are defined by a directory in
   [system](./system/). In theory these configurations are at the highest level,
   but we suspect that architecture-specific configurations leak into lower
   levels, e.g., with new Apple Silicon based macs.
   Cf. [Mitchell Hashimoto's nixos setup][mitchellh_nixos_config] to see how
   vms are used to abstract some of these nuances away. We may settle upon
   a pattern where some hosts are abstract, to have common files to apply to
   a company mandated MacBook vs a personal one. This would be obviated to
   an extent if we worked mostly inside vms for what little development
   work we do.
1. [profiles](./profiles/) contains collections of configurations for a specific
   operating mode, e.g., system-wide package configurations. Our normal
   style is to push most package configurations to the user level.
1. [hm (home-manager)](./hm) The user-specific program configurations
   that will be managed by home-manager. Typicaly these profiles are host
   agnostic to the extent possible.
1. [lib directory](./lib/) for common library functions used in this flake.
   These libs will serve to implement some of the boilerplate that gets
   taken care of by [flake-utils-plus][flake-utils-plus] or [digg][digga].
   Most likely we will end up using an external library once we are
   comfortable enough with nix.
1. [overlays](./overlays) containing package overrides, e.g., to use a
   different channel. Not used much if at all at the moment.

# Install nix

On platforms other than NixOS, we must first install nix itself in order to
build the flake.

```bash

if [ "$(uname -s)" = "Darwin" ]; then
    xcode-select --install
fi
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
# or
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```
The latter installation method is from https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer.

# macOS

macOS systems are managed with nix-darwin and home-manager.
nix-darwin surfaces a NixOS like system configuration for
macs.

## Installation

We install nix-darwin by building this flake for a specific host. For
example, `host âˆˆ {work, macbook, intel, ...}` and should correspond to one of
`darwinConfigurations` in [flake.nix](./flake.nix).

Below are some possible steps to perform after installing nix but
before switching the configuration with nix-darwin.

Clone and build the flake for a specified target, e.g

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawnohare/nixos-config
cd nixos-config
nix --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" build ".#darwinConfigurations.${host}.system"
result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake ".#${host}"
```

Alternatively
```bash
bin/switch system ${host}
# for example
bin/switch system wmbp2022
```

### nix-darwin Installation Troubleshooting

nix-darwin might fail if it cannot find `/run`. Try

```bash
printf 'run\tprivate/var/run\n' | sudo tee -a /etc/synthetic.conf
/System/Library/Filesystems/apfs.fs/Contents/Resources/apfs.util -t
```

nix-darwin might fail to write certain files if they already exist. Try
```bash
sudo mv /etc/nix/nix.conf /etc/nix/nix-darwin.bak.nix.conf
sudo mv /etc/shells /etc/nix-darwin.bak.shells
```

## Rebuilding

After the initialization `darwin-rebuild` is available and the configuration
can be rebuilt via

```bash
darwin-rebuild switch --flake "~/nixos-config#${host}"
# or
bin/switch system ${host}
```

We must obtain the nix package manager and build the flake, which will
provide nix-darwin and home-manager.

# home-manager

To build a home-manager configuration for the first time

```bash
nix build --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" ".#homeConfigurations.${host}.activationPackage"
./result/activate
# or
bin/switch home ${host}
```

## Management of config files

Originally we managed configuration files via committing them to a version
controlled repository and then symlinking them into the appropriate location
via tools such as GNU `stow` or our own bash replacement. The benefit here is
that once the files are linked, changes can be made to the source and they will
propagate without re-linking. Only when new files are added do we need to
re-link.

Then we utilized a bare git repository that contained all configuration files.
The benefit here is that there are no symlinks at all, so changes are immediate
and require no rebuilds. The downside with a bare repo is that one must
explicitly pass the git dir and work tree as arguments to `git`, which itself
is more or less trivial. But then the basic commands tend to have a lot of
clutter. Many things get ignored, there are many untracked files, etc.


Using home-manager's builtin modules to configure applications or even the
symlinking capabilities does involve a rebuild after any configuration change.
This is because the source file in the repository gets copied to the nix store
and then linked. For rapid configuration changes this is a bit of a pain, but
can be alleviated perhaps by manually symlinking the file.

Presently most of our configuration files are managed via the bare git
repository strategy, but ideally they are centralized in a single location. Our
plan is to move more configuration over to home-manager modules once the
underlying configuration is mature. There is a mild downside to this approach
in that it introduces yet another abstraction layer over the configuration
files. The long term benefit is that mature applications will likely have
robust home-manager modules.
